# MeshNetwork
A network of self-routing nodes. Used to transfer data asynchronously over TCP.

In order to run this, you'll need `boost` (latest version is recommended), download from http://www.boost.org/
and build it using the default output path: on windows it should be `C:\Boost` and on Unix `/usr/local`

Example of usages can be found in https://github.com/iliedanila/PubSub
